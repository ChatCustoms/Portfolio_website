        Hello! I'm Stephano Chatham, a passionate software developer with a
        knack for creating innovative solutions. With a background in full-stack
        development and a love for coding, I enjoy tackling complex problems and
        turning ideas into reality. When I'm not coding, you can find me
        exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or
        indulging in my love for 3d printing.
